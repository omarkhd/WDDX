From [Wikipedia WDDX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WDDX):
> WDDX (Web Distributed Data eXchange) is a programming language-, platform- and transport-neutral data interchange
> mechanism to pass data between different environments and different computers. It supports simple data types
> such as number, string, boolean, etc., and complex aggregates of these in forms such as structures, arrays and
> recordsets (row/column data, typically coming from database queries). There are WDDX interfaces for a wide
> variety of languages, including ColdFusion, Ruby, Python, PHP, Java, C++, .NET, Actionscript, lisp, Haskell, Perl.
